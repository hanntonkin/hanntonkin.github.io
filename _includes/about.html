  <p>My name is <u>Ha</u>i-<u>N</u>guyen <u>N</u>guyen. I am also known by my initials as Hann, which is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courtesy_name"> a writen name</a>  in Vietnamese culture. My family name, "Nguyen," is pronounced "Wien."</p>

  <p>
    Since July 2021, I have been a Contract Research Scientist at <a href="{{ site.imperial }}">LAAS-CNRS</a>, France, working together with <a href="{{ site.snu }}"> Dr. Simon Laxcroix</a>.

  <p>
    In February 2018, I earned my PhD. in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering in February 2018 from Seoul National University in Korea, where my academic advisor was <a href="https://www.inrol.snu.ac.kr/dongjun-lee">Prof. Dongjun Lee</a>. From 2018 to 2020, I was a Research Associate at Aerial Robotics Lab at Imperial College London, working with <a href="http://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/m.kovac">Prof. Mirko Kovac</a>. I also spent one year (2020-2021) developing autonomous vehicles for inventory applications with Vimaan Robotics, Inc., in California, USA (remotely due to COVID-19 and visa delay).

  <p>
    My research is in the field of control theory and autonomous systems. My current focus is on empowering aerial robots with advanced manipulation capabilities with the emphasis on Robustness and dexterity.
