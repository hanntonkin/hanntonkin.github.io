      In February 2018, I earned my PhD. in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering in February 2018 from <a href="https://en.snu.ac.kr/index.html">Seoul National University</a> in Korea, where my academic advisor was <a href="https://www.inrol.snu.ac.kr/dongjun-lee">Prof. Dongjun Lee</a>. From 2018 to 2020, I was a Research Associate at Aerial Robotics Lab at <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/">Imperial College London</a>, working with <a href="http://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/m.kovac">Prof. Mirko Kovac</a>. I also spent one year (2020-2021) developing autonomous vehicles for inventory applications with <a href="https://vimaan.ai/">Vimaan Robotics, Inc.</a>, in California, USA (remotely due to COVID-19 and visa delay).
